# Hypo programming language

Welcome to the webplace for the **Hypo programming language!**

**Hypo** is hypotheical programming language, hence the name, that I would like to
work in.

There is no implementation. This place is only here for me to organiza my thoughts
and around what set of features I would like the language to have. If you are here
it's most likely because I have given you the link. If you have come here from some
other place then:
**Welcome!** What you will find here are the mad ramblings of an
Internet stranger!

As I said. **Hypo** is a programming language I would like to work with.
Keywords are **I** and **work**. While I could see myself doing hobby projects in
Hypo that is not what it's meant for.

So, what sort of work do I do? Well, I mostly work with creating backend systems
using Java and that's the sort of domain I see Hypo being used for. Other programming
languages in the same domain are C# and Golang.

This already put some constraints on Hypo:
- Hypo is a statically typed programming language
- Hypo is a garbage collected language
- Hypo is syntactically a member of the C programming family

Another way to interpret the quote "language I would like to work with" is how I
would like to develop Hypo.

For example, garbage collection is great for the domain I invision Hypo to be used
for, but it is also really fun to develop one!<br>
I consider the challenges of implementing a garbage collector more interesting than
those of implementing something like a borrows checker and therefore it's what Hypo
will use.

That's not saying a borrows checker isn't great or fullfilling to develop, just that
it's not for me.
